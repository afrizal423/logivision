# LogiVision

## Project Overview

LogiVision is an AI-powered logistics assistant that uses Google Gemini 3 Flash to optimize storage spaces. It analyzes uploaded photos alongside inventory text lists to provide placement suggestions, safety audits, and space utilization metrics.

## Key Features & Logic

- **Placement Engine**: Uses physics-based logic (Heavy items on bottom, fragile on top).
- **Safety Auditor**: Detects OSH/K3 hazards (liquids, blocked exits, etc.) and renders them as high-priority Pulsing Red Overlays.
- **Utilization Scoring**: AI estimates area density (0-100%) visualized with progress bars.
- **Search & Filter**: Client-side filtering (`filterItems`) allows users to search the map in real-time.
- **PDF Export Engine**: A robust client-side generator that builds a dedicated A4 DOM structure to produce clean, multi-page reports.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 10 (PHP ^8.1)
- **AI**: Gemini 3 Flash (via HTTP Header Auth)
- **Frontend**: Blade, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JS
- **PDF**: html2canvas + jsPDF

## Key Files

- `app/Http/Controllers/InventoryController.php`: Manages the Gemini prompt engineering and JSON response parsing.
- `resources/views/landing.blade.php`: The new SaaS-style entry point with features and clear CTA.
- `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`: The main application view containing the dashboard UI, visual overlay logic, search functionality, and PDF generation scripts.
- `routes/web.php`: Updated routing structure (`/` -> Landing, `/app` -> Application).
- `.env`: Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

## Development Conventions

- **Responsive Imaging**: Image containers use `max-w-full` and `h-auto` with specific max-heights to support both portrait and landscape orientations without distortion (penyet).
- **Interactive Syncing**: Bidirectional hover effects are implemented via `onmouseenter`/`onmouseleave` using unique IDs (`box-x` and `item-x`).
- **Data Attributes**: HTML elements for items use `data-name` for real-time search filtering.
- **PDF Styling**: The PDF is generated by creating an off-screen clone of the data, ensuring that the exported report layout is optimized for A4 regardless of screen scaling.
- **Density Color Coding**: 
    - < 50%: `#22c55e` (Green)
    - 50-80%: `#eab308` (Yellow)
    - \> 80%: `#ef4444` (Red)
